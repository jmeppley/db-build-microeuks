### Draft snakemake pipeline to build database for 18S tag-seq

_Workflow_
* Download recent version of PR2
* Set up working conda environment
* Option to set up to run snakemake with slurm
* Modify config.yaml file
* Import fasta and tax files as qiime2 artifacts
* subset V4 hypervariable region
* train classifer (Naive Bayes classifier)
* check output
* log version, etc.


### (1) Set up your database working directory
I recommend the [Protist Ribosomal 2 - PR2 database](https://github.com/pr2database/pr2database) for 18S tag-sequencing.

```
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/shu251/db-build-microeuks.git
cd db-build-microeuks # migrate to repo directory

# Download PR2 database (or database of choice)
wget "https://github.com/pr2database/pr2database/releases/download/4.11.1/pr2_version_4.11.1_mothur.tax.gz"
wget "https://github.com/pr2database/pr2database/releases/download/4.11.1/pr2_version_4.11.1_mothur.fasta.gz"
gunzip *mothur*.gz
```

### (2) Install conda environment

The conda environment (or Anaconda environment) here will contain all the required programs to run the database prep and ASV pipeline in QIIME2. For more information, see this [blog post](https://alexanderlabwhoi.github.io/post/anaconda-r-sarah/) on how I set up R environments using anaconda.  
There is an 'environment' file (```snake-18S-env.yaml```) in this repo that you can use to create a conda environment that will have *Snakemake*, *QIIME2*, and *R*. [More on using conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).  

##### _Why snakemake?_
[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a tool to manage your bioinformatic pipeline. Using the snakemake framework, we can build complex workflows that are more robust, scalable, and reproducible. This is highly recommended if you are working with HPC, as it plays very nicely with slurm. There is a learning curve when diving into snakemake, but there are many helpful tutorials online and already build (snakemake wrappers or rules)[https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html] that you can use.

```
conda env create -f /envs/snake-18S-env.yaml --name snake-18S 

# Enter environment
source activate snake-18S

# Check versions and correct environment set up
snakemake --version
qiime info
```
Output from snakemake should be ```5.4.0```, and the qiime info will list installed plugins and system versions for python and qiime. Python version should be >3.6 and QIIME2 release should be at least 2019.4 (as of writing this README).

#### (2.1) Option to set up snakemake to run with slurm
Cookiecutter should already be installed, if not, [follow these instructions](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to install within the snake-18S environment.   
Then follow these instructions to [enable snakemake to run with slurm](https://github.com/Snakemake-Profiles/generic).
_need additional clarifiation on how this needs to be set up to run on your machine, alternate option is to select the number of threads to use..., right?_

### (3) Modify config.yaml


Enter your preferred text editor to modify ```config.yaml```. _An explanation of how mine is structured is below_.

```
# Contents of config.yaml with annotation
## Location of the PR2 database (fasta and taxonomy file)
ref_db: /vortexfs1/omics/huber/shu/db/pr2_version_4.11.1_mothur.fasta
ref_tax: /vortexfs1/omics/huber/shu/db/pr2_version_4.11.1_mothur.tax

## version information of your database
version: pr2_4.11.1

## I'm using a HPC with a scratch directory that will be my output directory
scratch: /vortexfs1/scratch/sarahhu

## Primer sequences for Forward and Reverse
primerF: CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC
primerR: ACTTTCGTTCTTGATYRA
db_region: V4 # Region of the barcode that these primers highlight
```

### (4) Snakemake dry run

```
snakemake -n -r
bash gen-profile/submit-slurm_dry.sh

# Getting an error at the classify step
# bash gen-profile/submit-slurm.sh
```

_Next steps_
* Troubleshoot primer inputs, qiime2 + snakemake isn't working with params??
